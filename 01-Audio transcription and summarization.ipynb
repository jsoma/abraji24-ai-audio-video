      "1. **Small Holes (up to 1.5 inches/3.8 cm):**\n",
      "   - Use mud to fill in these tiny holes without needing tape or a patch kit. Generic mud bought from a store is sufficient.\n",
      "   - Apply mud with a putty knife, ensuring it packs firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Medium Holes (up to fist-sized, around 4-5 inches/10-12.7 cm):**\n",
      "   - Three methodologies: \n",
      "     - **Mesh Adhesive Patch:** Smooth out over the hole, apply mud generously to cover.\n",
      "     - **Presto Patch:** Cut a template, fit in the patch, and apply mud around and within the patch.\n",
      "     - **California Patch:** Make a custom patch from drywall, apply mud, and fit it in just like the Presto Patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Larger Holes (up to 10 inches/25.4 cm):**\n",
      "   - Require backer boards for extra support.\n",
      "   - Clean the edges, use some wood as backer boards, screw them in for support, and then fit the patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Major Damage (large sections):**\n",
      "   - Cut from stud to stud using a stud finder and then replace the entire section.\n",
      "   - Fasten the new drywall piece, use mesh tape on seams, and apply mud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the fixes, the importance of smoothing and layering mud, sanding, and ensuring a seamless texture is stressed. Various texture sprays (like orange peel or knockdown) help match the original wall surface. Different stud finders can be referenced for accuracy in finding the studs. \n",
